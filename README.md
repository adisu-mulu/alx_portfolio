Research papers recommender system: Portfolio Project for ALX

The portfolio project is a research papers recommender system which allows students
and researchers to find relevant papers based on title and abstract.

The system uses technologies such as html, css and javascript for the front end and flask(python) with
Gunicorn as the application server. The system queries different research databases such as arxiv using
their publicly made available APIs.

Usage:
The system has been deployed at portfolio.adisumulu.tech. Users can choose between the options to search by title
or by abstract. Then they will enter their query and click search.
