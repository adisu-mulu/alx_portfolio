Portfolio Project for ALX

The portfolio project is a research papers recommender system which allows students
and researchers to find relevant papers based on title and abstract.
The system has been deployed and can be accessed at portfolio.adisumulu.tech

The system uses technologies such as html, css and javascript for the front end and flask(python) with
Gunicorn as the application server. The system queries different research databases such as arxiv using
their publicly made available APIs.
